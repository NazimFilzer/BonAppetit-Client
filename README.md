<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Did you know that about 40 % of the food produced in India is wasted?
Despite adequate food production, the UN has reported that about 190 million Indians remain undernourished. It is further estimated that the
value of food wastage in India is around ₹92,000 crores per annum.
These are some bleak statistics, but they should help us realise the magnitude of the problem of food waste, as much as inequity, in India.
The world recognises that no truly sustainable and developed country can exist without tackling the issue of food waste, and while the challenge
in front of us may be monumental, some steps need to be taken sooner than others.

This is why, we came up with the idea of  Bon Appetit.

Bon Appetit is a platform where the users can connect with non-profits for food donation purposes.
We have found out that there are so many good hearted people out there who are willing to contribute food to the ones in need.
Some of the problems they face are 
* They do not know who to donate to
* Transport is an issue
* Trying to contact NGO's.

Our platform aims to solve these issues by providing accounts for the Organizations and the volunteers.
Volunteers can post the amount of food they have and their location and the Organizations can accept the donation.
